We conduct some analyses that, put simply, suggests that where UC
Berkeley should be spending roughly twice as much as UC Santa Barbara
on non-teaching/non-research salaries but instead spends up to two and
a half times to three times as much.  A move to UCSB's level of
``overheads'' would save hundreds of millions of dollars in
compensation alone.  The bulk of these savings appear in Management,
Administration, and Finance areas and some savings also appear in
Computing and Student Services.

In particular, we compute ``overheads'' which is the ratio of of
noninstructional/nonresearch salary to salary of those devoted
directly towards supporting teaching and research. This measure is
convenient as for for institutions to be equally efficient in this
measure, they should have equal overhead percentages.

These calculations indicate that the overhead for UC Berkeley is
roughly 215\%, while for UC Santa Barbara it is roughly 159\%. While
neither figure is small, it does suggest that bringing UC Berkeley's
numbers more in line with UC Santa Barbara's would generate
significant savings, quite possibly, completely dealing with the
budget deficit of \$150 million.

We welcome feedback about any potential gaps in this analysis.

\section{Introduction}

We conduct some analyses that, put simpily, suggests that where in UC
Berkeley should be spending roughly twice as much as UC Santa Barbara
on non-teaching/non-research salaries but instead spends up to two and
a half times as much.  A move to UCSB's level of ``overheads'' would
save hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation alone.  The bulk
of these potential savings appear in Management, Administration and Finance
areas and some savings also appear in Computing and Student Services.

We discuss UC Berkeley's overheads on teaching and research largely by
comparison with UC Santa Barbara, the next largest member of the UC
System that does not have an associated medical center. This ongoing
analysis centers on salaries, which along with associated benefits
comprise the bulk of Berkeley's expenditures. These analyses suggests
that Berkeley could save in excess of \$200 million annually, if UC
Berkeley overheads were more in line with those at UC Santa Barbara.

Our central definition is that of overhead rate; the ratio of salary
spent on non-direct teaching and research efforts to the salary spent
on those directly teaching and doing research.  This is consistent
with research overhead rates, and should be equal for equally
efficient universities.

We make no claim, nor do we believe that UC Santa Barbara is
especially effective with respect to overhead rate, just more
effective than UC Berkeley.

We note this is a working document, and welcome feedback about
any gaps in our analysis.

We note there is perhaps something to learn from best practices
elsewhere beyond employee compensation. For example, it appears Santa
Barbara escapes significant expenses (on the order of \$77 million) in student
healthcare which Berkeley does not (and to be fair, neither does
UCLA); See section~\ref{sec:healthcare}. It is also worth noting that an area where
UCB's overhead percentage significantly exceeds UCSB's is management
expenditures --- \$136 million (59\% overhead rate)
versus \$29 million (26\% overhead rate).




\section{Overhead Calculations}

We proceed in the next sections with calculations that use
two data sources with different views of salary expenditures.
The two yield similar results.  

\subsection{IPEDS 2014.}

The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is
maintained by the National Center for Education System and collects
information from colleges and university using standardized
methodologies.

We use these data to compare UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara overhead
rates overall in this section, and on specific functions in the next
subsection.

From 2014 IPEDS datafiles \cite{ipeds-is}, we have UC
Berkeley spending \$232 million on faculty salary compared to UC Santa
Barbara's \$112 million.  For non instructional salary totals,
we have UCB \$653 million versus UCSB \$208 million \cite{ipeds-nis}. 

The non-instructional salaries include research salaries which are
\$82 million (UCB) and \$25 million (UCSB). UCB spends
significantly more than UCSB, \$25 million versus \$4 million, on the category
of ``Librarians, Curators, Archivists and Academic Affairs and Other
Education Services - outlays'' which we categorize as directly serving
our research, teaching and public service mission.

Deducting those costs from the total non-instructional salary reported
to IPEDS leaves \$546 million for UC Berkeley versus \$179 million for
UC Santa Barbara for total overhead.

{\bf Basic Calculation.} The effective overhead of this calculation
for UCB is 235\%, and 159\% for UCSB.  Were
Berkeley consistent with Santa Barbara on this overhead, its
non-instructional salaries would engender a savings of \$177 million in
salary alone.

Using an estimated associated benefit rate of 36\% as suggested by
\cite{rev-trends},  yields a saving of \$240 million dollars in
salaries and benefits alone using data from 2014 data.  More recent
data which we discuss below suggests a widening gap between Berkeley
and Santa Barbara.

%%%The following three paragraphs are confusing. Move to a separate subsection???
Of course, one could argue that research induces overhead as well.
%% The first yields a possibly illegal overhead rate on federal funds of
%% 174\% for Berkeley.  
Thus, we include a calculation where the rate is
limited to 57\%: the federally negotiated overhead on research grants.

%% {\bf Large Research Overhead Calculation.} We add research and faculty
%% salaries which yield totals \$314 million (UCB) and \$137 million
%% (UCSB). The associated overhead rates are then respectively 174\% and
%% 152\%.  The associated savings for Berkeley were these equal wouldbe  94
%% million (using the calculation $1.36\times (546 - 314\times1.52)$).

{\bf Standard Research Overhead Calculation.} We set the research
overheads limited to say 57\% (our typical research overhead rate), we
remove that from the overheads instead getting ``teaching overheads''
of 499 million \footnote{We calculate by reducing the \$546 million by the federal overhead on
  \$ 82 million.} and 165 million, respectively.  This teaching
overhead rate then becomes 215\% and 147\%.  Equalizing that overhead
would save \$214 million.

\subsubsection{Specific areas for further examination.}

These are from the IPEDS non-instructional staff data
\cite{ipeds-nis}.  

In the following, we are reporting UCB versus UCSB numbers, respectively.
We impute savings by reducing the overhead rate of UCB to that computed
for UCSB.  We are again using overhead rates as the ratio of
salaries to teaching salaries: \$232 million for UC Berkeley
and \$112 million for UC Santa Barbara.

{\bf Management Overheads.} \$136 million (59\%) versus \$29 million (26\%). Imputed
savings: \$75 million in salary, \$102 million total compensation.

{\bf Business/Finance.} \$97 million ( 42\%) versus \$31 million (28 \%). Imputed savings:
\$32 million in salary, \$43 million in total compensation.

{\bf Office and Administrative Support.}  \$69 million (30\%) versus
\$20 million (18\%). Imputed savings: \$28 million in salary, \$38 million in total compensation.

{\bf Student Services.} \$64 million (28\%) versus \$19 million (17\%). Imputed savings:
\$25 million in salary, \$34  million in total compensation. 

{\bf Computer, Engineering, and Science.} \$105 million (45\%) versus \$37 million
(33\%). Imputed savings: \$28 million in salary, \$38 million in total compensation.
\footnote{We expect this particular category may have good justification via differences in research activity.}


\subsection{Salary data}

We also worked with salary data files \cite{salary}.  This data is a
different way of looking at the picture: it provides per employee
salary and title and includes all employees.  Our analsis is heuristic
but yields conclusions consistent with those above.

Here we computed direct and indirect salary expenditures
for 2015. The computation is embodied in publicly available code
\cite{github-link}.

{\bf Regular Pay.}  Our heuristics estimate total direct salaries
(teaching,research, museum, agronomists) as \$379 million and \$173
million out of total salaries \$1082 million and \$415 million for
Berkeley and Santa Barbara respectively.  This is using the regular
pay fields in that data.

Imputed overhead rates are 185\% and 140\%.  Equalizing
would save Berkeley \$170 million in salary or \$232 million in total
compensation. 

{\bf Total Wages.} Using total wages rather than base pay
(e.g., including summer salary), we get \$440 million and \$194 million
out of \$1185 million and \$447 million.  Imputed overhead rates are 

Imputed overhead rates are 169\% and 127\%.  Equalizing
would save Berkeley \$185 million in salary or \$252 million in total
compensation. 

{\bf Adjusting for auxillary.} One could legitimately
remove things like housing associated salaries from overhead since
they are paid for from pools that are distinct
from the research/teaching/public service missions.
Thus, we use data from 2015 Consolidated Financial
Reports \cite{UCSB-consolidated,UCB-consolidated}
which suggest that auxilary salaries and wages
are \$46 million and \$36 million respectively. We note that.

With these adjustments to say the total wage
scenario we get imputed overhead rates of
158\% and 112\%.  Equalizing would save
Berkley 180 million in salary or 245 million in total
compensation.

\section{Other Questions/Issues.}
\label{sec:healthcare}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
{\bf Student health expenditures} from the Berkeley Consolidated
Report \cite{UCB-consolidated} in 2015 has a non-salary expense of
\$72 million.  For Santa Barbara \cite{UCSB-consolidated} this is
\$11 million. Admittedly, UCLA Consolidated Report \cite{UCLA-consolidated}
also contains a large non-salary expense for this category.

\item
{\bf The number of Affiliates/Non-Employees} has moved from 1921 in
2008 to 4209 in 2016 \cite{cal-answer-census}.  Do these people incur
expense? Are they included in salary data?

\item
{\bf Other Provisions} increased from a \$20 million in the 2014 Consolidated
Financial Statement \cite{UCB-consolidated-14} to \$123 million in the 2015
Consolidated Financial Statement \cite{UCB-consolidated}.  This amount
is assigned to Cost of Instruction (as for example is the vast
majority of the Deans offices).  One wonders what Other Provisions is,
especially with respect to instruction.  The amounts for UC Santa
Barbara and UCLA are non-existent with respect to instruction.

\item
{\bf Financial Aid}. Santa Barbara appears to provide more
percentage-wise in terms of financial aid: \$135 million(58\%)
for Berkeley versus \$83 million (74\%).  

\end{enumerate}

\section{Some remarks.}

For Berkeley to function, one certainly needs many people beyond
teachers and researchers to properly accomplish our mission. For
example, we certainly need an admissions office and a registrar. These
absolutely central tasks, however, cost a modest \$4.5 million and \$3.5 million in total.
Berkeley, moreover, is slightly more efficient than Santa Barbara in this
categories.

For comparison purposes, Dean's offices total expenses are around
\$47.5 million and Vice Chancellors another \$34 million.  Again, Santa Barbara does
better in these categories.

Incidentally, faculty brought in roughly \$748 million in research funds in
2015, and the overhead on this of \$175 million.   Moreover, millions more on
graduate student researcher tuition goes directly to the university
for roughly 2000 GSR positions.  For comparison purposes faculty
(non-summer,non-lecturer) wages are around \$210 million.
