Dear Colleagues,

As you know, there is a budget deficit at Berkeley, and as you've
heard from the chairs two mondays ago, we are being asked to generate
the revenue to fix it at the expense of our current missions. This is
only the first step in a more global administration policy to generate
additional revenue by asking faculty to do more.

But before we start working harder shouldn't we ask whether there is a
leak in the bucket? In the attached document, I suggest a simple
measure, effective overhead rate, for evaluating efficiency on a
campus with respect to employee compensation.  I use two public data
sources and evaluate our efficiency with respect to UC Santa Barbara
(next largest UC, without a medical center).  I conclude that if UC
Berkeley were as efficient as UC Santa Barbara, we would spend roughly
200 million dollars less on non-faculty/non-research employee
compensation.

Furthermore, by this measure, Berkeley has gotten worse since 2011 and
Santa Barbara has gotten better.

Finally, analysis by our colleagues on the Committee on Academic
Resources and Planning (CAPRA) also suggests that the budget deficit
could be solved through elimination of central campus employee expenses 
not directly involved in mission.

Cheers,
Satish
