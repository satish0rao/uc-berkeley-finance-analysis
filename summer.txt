Hello Jitendra, Jim, and Jan,

Jim asked for me to summarize my input on
summer sessions for your Monday meeting.

First, I believe we need to re-organize expenditures
for summer offerings both if we expect to grow them and
perhaps even to maintain our current practice.  
The first thing, which should be simple, is to by
default hire two instructors full-time for large
courses, say 200 or 250.  This is consistent with
our own internal accounting for awarding more heaven
points for large courses to our faculty.  Also,
currently, according to Josephine faculty can't
get paid to teach in summer sessions; I think this
should be looked into.  There is the rare possibility
that this could be an option, especially around
co-teaching.  A month of summer salary seems appropriate;
indeed, here too, I believe, there is precedent for paying
faculty for service in the summer.  

There may be other changes needed to attract upper division
students to be teaching assistants in the summer; they
currently can all get internships and would be hard pressed
to sacrifice so much to teach.  Perhaps offering tuition
support for a summer class would be an option there.

Finally, I suggest that perhaps we understand the profit
sharing percentages.  Perhaps we should re-negotiate that 
percentage at this time when we are being asked to
grow our offerings.

Cheers,
Satish
